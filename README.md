## Shopify Internship Test  
Repository storing the code I submitted for an internship opportunity at Shopify.

### Task #1 - ./shopicruit  
Given a JSON file, the program must take the maximum number of items without passing the limit of 100kg, and then, calculate the total price.

### Task #2 - ./reviewed-code  
Some code examples were give to me, and I should review them, and then, say what I would change to improve these codes.
